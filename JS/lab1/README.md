# Dataytpes Lab
### Introduction
The following section details a list of code to implement in order to further your understanding of datatypes in JavaScript.  
  
This lab is covered by tests, these tests will fail until you write the code necessary to make them pass.

### Lab

1: Create variables to hold the following information about a dog:
  * name
  * weight
  * length of tail
  * whether or not it is friendly
  
Assign these variables with values of the corresponding types.
  
**NOTE**: In JavaScript variables are not statically typed, their type is set dynamically based on values.  
  
2: Use `console.log()` to log the value of each of the variables to the console.  
  
3: Re-assign the following variables with boolean values.  
  
```javascript
var age = 9;
var address = '1908 Sout Banana Street';
var date = '12/4/2018';
var url = 'http://localhost:8080';
```

4: Create an array literal in a variable named `months`, add each of the twelve months stored as strings. Use `console.log()` to log the month you were born.  
  
5: Declare a variable 'name', but don't initialize it with a variable. Use `console.log()` to print out the variable, what is the result?
