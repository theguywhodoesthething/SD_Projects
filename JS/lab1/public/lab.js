1: Create variables to hold the following information about a dog:
  * name
  * weight
  * length of tail
  * whether or not it is friendly

Assign these variables with values of the corresponding types.

2: Use 'console.log()' to log the value of each of the variables to the console.

3: Re-assign the following variables with boolean values:
