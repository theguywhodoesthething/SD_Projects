/*
1 : Invoke a function named 'greet', pass your name to the function as an 
argument ...  

***NOTE:*** At the moment, this will throw `ReferenceError: greet is not defined`
*/

/***********Your Solution************/

/************************************/

/*
2 : Write a function **declaration** named 'greet' which takes one argument (name).  
  
'greet' should return the string 'Hello {name}' where {name} is the name provided
as an argument.

/*
3 : Invoke a function named 'farewell', pass your name to the function as an 
argument ...  
  
***NOTE:*** This function will also throw `ReferenceError: greet is not defined`
*/

/***********Your Solution************/

/************************************/

/*
4 : Write a function **expression** named 'farewell', the assigned function 
should take one argument ('name').  
  
'farewell' should return the string 'Goodbye {name}' where {name} is the name 
provided as an argument.  
  
***NOTE:*** The correct solution to this exercise will produce a TypeError. It 
is important that you understand why this error (instead of a `ReferenceError`) 
is produced. With your pair think about how the JS interpreter is evaluating the 
function expression and try to determine exactly what is happening. If you can 
not discern why a TypeError has occured ask an instructor for help.

/*
5 : Create a new function **expression** named 'sayHello', assign it the value 
of the 'greet' function declaration.  
  
Invoke 'sayHello' and pass it your name. What is the result?  
  
***NOTE***: At first this code will be unreachable because of the unrecoverable 
error encountered in your solution to #3. This is a fairly common problem in 
JavaScript development, if the interpreter encounters an error in a chain of 
function executions it will just stop executing the chain...making it seem as 
though things just aren't working. Usually this results from a value being 
`undefined` when it needed to be something else (e.g. a function). Surround that 
answer in a `try/catch` in order to allow the interpreter to continue.

/*
6 : Create a function expression named 'interact'.  
  
Assign interact an anonymous function.  
  
This function should have three parameters:  

* The first parameter 'begin', will be passed a function which returns a string

* The second parameter 'end', will also be passed a function which returns a 
string

* The third parameter 'name', will be a string
  
Within the body of 'interact', invoke 'begin' with the 'name', and concatenate 
it's return value with a space (" ") followed by the return value of 'end' invoked 
with 'name'. Return the resulting string.
*/

/*
7 : Invoke 'interact', pass it three arguments:  
  
* your 'sayHello' function expression

* your 'farewell' function expression

* your name
  
If you don't understand what is happending, modify your anonymous function in #6 
to log the values of begin and end to the console.
