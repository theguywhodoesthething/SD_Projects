# RNA Transcription  
  
Write a program that, given a DNA strand, returns its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).  
  
Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.  
  
The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).  
  
The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).  
  
Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:  
  
* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`
  
### Setup
* Create a function named 'toRna(nucleo)' in the `public/rna.js` file.
  
* Open `index.html` in your browser to view test results, as well as console output for the file.
