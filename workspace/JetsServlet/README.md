# Jets Servlet
You are implementing a Servlet that GET's Jets. A set of JUnit tests defines the functionality. You must get the tests to pass.

There is no web container for this Servlet. You do not have to worry about any actual views. You only care that the method(s) forward to the correct JSP pages. (You have seen this in the weekly course content). Simply run the Unit tests _Run As->JUnit Test_.

Do not change the tests. Only implement the JetsServlet methods. You will use the DAO to retrieve jets, so reading its code may help.
