There are three StringBuilder objects in the HashSet.

java.lang.StringBuilder does not override the equals() or hashCode() methods.  
The methods inherited from java.lang.Object rely on the object reference ID, which is different for each object.  Therefore, two StringBuilders holding identical strings, will return false from equals().
